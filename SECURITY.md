# 🔐 Security Policy

## 🛠 Supported Versions

This SDK is still in active development and not officially versioned in a formal release process. That said, here's the current state of support:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | ✅ (actively used) |
| < main  | ❌ (not supported) |

Since this is a personal project layered on top of Misty's official API, any "security" concerns are more about misuse or broken behavior rather than major vulnerabilities. But feel free to reach out if you spot something odd.

## 📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've found a vulnerability or unintended behavior that could affect others using this SDK:

- Open an issue [on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/lxwooxy/Misty-Python-SDK/issues) and tag it with `security`
- Or, if you'd rather keep it private, email me directly (georgina.woo30@myhunter.cuny.edu)

I’ll do my best to respond within a few days. If it's something serious or impacts other Misty devs, I’ll patch it ASAP and update the repo with a note.

This is a fun/experimental project, but I care about keeping things clean and safe to use. Appreciate your help!
